Only the (strictly non personal) data collected via mobile app is stored in a data repository, no other service stores any information. The data that is collected by our platform is stored in a repository, unless otherwise stated.This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services.</p>
            <h2>The short version</h2>
            <p>We collect your information only with your consent; <strong>we DO NOT collect any personal information via our mobile app or any information unique to your mobile device such as phone number, serial or IMEI numbers;</strong> we only collect the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us when using our web app; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Policy describes.</p>
            <p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>
            <h2>What information GreenHub collects and why</h2>
            <h3>Information from the mobile app</h3>
            <p>If you <strong>install and accept the terms of use</strong>, we will periodically collect information regarding the energy consumption of your mobile device. The collection of information is determined by the following events:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Every time the mobile device battery level changes (increases or decreases).
                Once one of these events take place, a sample of data will be gathered by the mobile app and stored locally on the mobile device.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>“Sample” is one instance of a collection of data that includes information such as battery current level, battery voltage, battery temperature, network connectivity details, sensors state (either if they are switched on or off), screen state (on or off), timezone, memory and CPU usage, etc.</p>
            <p>The samples collected via mobile app are sent automatically to our Services. The user may choose to upload the information manually or change on the mobile app preferences the interval of the automatic upload.</p>
            <p>Note that all data collected is purely about the device’s performance and power behavior. No personal user information is collected at any given moment. The mobile devices are identified on the Services by a randomly alphanumeric identifier used to distinguish each device in order to process the data.</p>
